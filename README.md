#### Brief Description of Project - 
           
 Managing hardware is a tedious and time-consuming task as hardware has to deal with many people. They are
suppliers, customers, reps, banks etc. A hardware management system is a system that helps the business
sector. This system helps to reduce bills, purchasing orders, cheques, cash, credit bills problems and human errors.
This system handles important areas such as inventory management, Employee management, supplier
management, Billing and barcoding, Transportation management, customer management, financial management
and after sales services. This is also useful for the system to automatically generate salary based on the attendance
of the employees. Jayaru Enterprises is a hardware company based in Battaramulla. Jayaru Enterprises aims to
develop its business by adding new technology. For that, they have planned to manage all the activities of the
organization through the system. We will build our most efficient and user-friendly hardware management system
